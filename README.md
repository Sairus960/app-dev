# SOTUS: The Series

## Overview
**SOTUS: The Series** is a 2016-2017 Thai BL television series starring Perawat Sangpotirat (Krist) and Prachaya Ruangroj (Singto). It is an adaptation of the novel SOTUS: พี่ว้ากตัวร้ายกับนายปีหนึ่ง by Bittersweet.

## Synopsis
In *SOTUS: The Series*, the "Gear" symbolizes the pride of belonging to the Faculty of Engineering. For freshmen to earn and wear this symbol, they must endure the S.O.T.U.S. system, a rigorous initiation designed to foster discipline and unity, led by third-year senior Arthit. Arthit's strict approach initially causes misunderstandings, particularly with Kongpob, sparking tension between the juniors and seniors. However, as the story unfolds, the bond between Arthit and Kongpob grows, leading them to develop a deeper connection and mutual affection.

## Main Characters
1. **Arthit "Oon" Rojnapat** - portrayed by Perawat Sangpotirat (Krist)
2. **Kongphop "Kong" Suttilak** - portrayed by Prachaya Prachaya Ruangroj (Singto)

## Why I Like It
I like this story because of how it portrays the reality of being gay—the confusion over one’s sexual orientation, the difficulty in accepting one’s true identity and feelings, and more. It’s so well done that it’s included in the so-called "Holy Trinity," the three best Thai BL couples/series.
